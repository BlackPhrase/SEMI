## General

### A "V-Engine"?

The name is coming from the engine's design approach - it's split into three main modules: core, server-side and client-side  
Client-side and server-side engine parts are directly interconnected with the core part, but not with each other  
This pretty much resembles a "V" letter and Vee configuration of internal combustion engines

Our client and server side modules are 2 "cylinders" and core is our "crankshaft" here
